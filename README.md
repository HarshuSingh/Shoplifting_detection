# Shoplifting_detection üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<h2> Description </h2>
A shoplifting detection system is a technological solution that uses various methods, such as computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, to identify instances of shoplifting or theft within a retail or commercial environment. The primary goal of such a system is to prevent theft, protect merchandise, and enhance the overall security of a store or business.

<h2>üå±Pre-requisites</h2>
import cv2 
import numpy
import time

<h2>ü™úSteps to be followed</h2>
* Import the files mentioned above.
* Provide the path of the video in which theft is to be detected.
* Then provide proper properties for the frame of the video and then write the code to create the output video detecting shoplifting.
* We will then further provide the parameters for motion and shoplifting detection.
* For proper motion detection we also need to convert the frame to grauscale.
* Then code to draw the bounding box, perform shoplifting analysis and check for shoplifting frames buffer.
* After all the analysis is done write the video in the same path mentioned above for the output and then release the captured video.

<h2>üì∏Snapshots of the output </h2>
